  After many experiences of going to the barber, waiting an hour, then getting a 30 minute hair cut and paying $25, it was a two-hour ordeal that I didn't want anymore.
  I already had a barber set from when my mom used to buzz cut our hair, and gave it a try. My go-to haircut is a skin fade to a number two on the side,
  then between 1/2" and 3/4" on the top with scissors.

<h2>Savings</h2>
Even though my first few hair cuts weren't quite up to par with the barbers, after reading about how to cut hair and practicing a few times, I can get a
haircut that I'm happy with every time. It takes me an hour total, which means each time I save an hour of my time and 25 dollars on each hair cut.
Assuming a hair cut every 2 months, this means I will save $150 a year and 6 hours of hassle going to the barber. In addition, I will get the hair
cut that I want every time without having to try to explain what I want to the barber.
