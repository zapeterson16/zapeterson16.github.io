  After going to the barber waiting an hour then getting a 30 minute hair cut and paying $25 it was a two hour ordeal that I didn't want anymore.
  I already had a barber set from when my mom used to buzz cut our hair, and gave it a try. My go to hair cut is a skin fade to a number two on the side,
  then between 1/2" and 3/4" on the top with scissors.

<h2>Savings</h2>
Even though my first few hair cuts weren't quite up to par with the barbers after reading about how to cut hair and practicing a few times I can get a
hair cut that I'm happy with every time. It takes me an hour total which means each time I save an hour of my time over going to the barber and 25 dollars. Assuming a hair cut every 2 months this means I will save $150 a year and 6 hours of hassle going to the barber. As well as get the hair
cut that I want every time without having to try to explain what I want to the barber.
