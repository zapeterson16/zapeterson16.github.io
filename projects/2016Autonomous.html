In 2016, I was the captain, head programmer and robot operator of <a href = "https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc">FIRST</a> Robotics Team 27, <a href = "http://www.teamrush27.net">Team RUSH</a>.
Check out the software that ran the robot in 2016 developed by me, with the autonomous portion being developed in collaboration with Wineman Technology.

  <h3>Where's the teamwork?</h3>
  <p>
    In 2016, I didn't develop the software alone because we didn't have any other programmers;
    we actually had 7 people, which is the largest programming team we had ever had.
    Before the 2016 season, I pushed for our team to switch from developing in
    LABView to Java, because Java is taught in school and more applicable to college curriculums.
    In order to facilitate the switch, I developed that year's software in LabVIEW, while the rest of the team, which
    was younger, developed in Java. This was done so that in the 2017 season, the robot could be
    developed entirely in Java.

  <h3>Automation</h3>
  <p>
    A key focus in 2016 for me was automating as much as I could; since I was also the robot operator, I was very familiar
    with how helpful it is during a match to have the robot do the work for me, so that I could focus on strategy.
    Developing the software and operating the robot the previous year, was a learning experience, because the software that I helped develop
    was lacking in automation, which made it hard to operate the robot.
    In 2016, the ball controls were very simple: one button to harvest the ball, one to prepare to shoot, and one to shoot.
    In addition, fully automated sequences were created for pulling down the drawbridge, lifting the gate and climbing the bar.
    This automation took the
    guesswork out of some of the most challenging sequences of moves that we had to do on the field.

  <h3>Autonomous mode</h3>
  <p>
    At the start of every match, the robot drives by itself with no human control for 15 seconds.
    This portion of the match is the hardest to program, because the robot needs to do everything on its own.
    There were two main challenges in 2016 to the autonomous mode; the first was getting over the obstacles.
    Each obstacle needed a different sequence of moves that could be switched at match time so that the robot
    could make it over the obstacle. The second major challenge was once the robot was over the obstacle, it
    wouldn't know where it was so it needed to use its gyroscope and cameras to vision track the target, drive towards it, and then shoot.
    To accomplish this, I developed a state machine which read instructions from a CSV file which could be switched on the fly.
    The CSV file described the sequence of events that needed to take place, including how to get over the obstacle at hand and
    when to start tracking towards the target. To vision track towards the target, I worked closely with <a href = "https://www.winemantech.com">Wineman Techonology</a>
    to develop the algorithm that finds the target in the image and drives towards it.
    Check out the video below to see the autonomous sequence in action. (Team RUSH is the yellow robot on the right side.)
