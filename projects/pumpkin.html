  Pumpkin helps manage time by providing a way to keep track of what you need to do with the task list.
  What you are working on with the pomodoro timer. What you've done with statistics.

  <h3>Tasks</h3>
  <p>
    Productivity is founded around tasks. If you don't know what needs to be done it will be hard to get it done.
    Pumpkin was created with this idea in mind. The first page when you open pumpkin is a task list.
    Tasks are given a subject so that they can be identified whether that subject is a class in school or a project at work.
    The tasks can be sorted by subject so that you can focus on a class or a project at a time.
    When you're ready to work it's as simple as clicking on a task.

  <h3>Pomodoro Timer</h3>
  <p>
    Working for a long time without dipping from peak preformance is tough. This is why the pomodoro technique was created.
    By having a break for your mind to refocus you can ork at peak preformance for longer.
    Each focus session of the pomodoro is 25 minutes long and during that 25 minutes only the task at hand should be focused on.
    After 25 minutes is over there is a five minute break. After every fourth focus session a longer break of 20 minutes is taken.

  <h3>Pomodoro Timer</h3>
  <p>
    Reflecting on the day is important.
    The stats page allows reflection on the amount of time spent focusing during the day and what tasks were focused on.
    Just because your somewhere where work should be getting done doesn't mean it is (<A href = "https://www.vouchercloud.com/blog/office-worker-productivity/"> check out this study</A>) the statistics page helps keep better track of how much is actually getting done.
