## What I built upon
<b>Template:</b> The original CSS for the site was done by <a href = "https://html5up.net">HTML5 UP</a> and the design was adapted to work with Jekyll and GitHub pages by <a href = "https://somiibo.com">Somiibo</a>.

<b>Hosting:</b> The website is hosted through GitHub, the source code is also hosted on GitHub (check out my <a href = "https://github.com/zapeterson16/zapeterson16.github.io">repository</a>). The website is built through the <a href = "https://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> site generator.

## What I did

<b>Content:</b> I wrote all the content and took all of the pictures that are on the website, besides a few of the logos(ex. the HTML and the FIRST logos). All the content is either in HTML or markdown

<b>Style and layout:</b> I wrote my own CSS and JavaScript code to format many of the pages and pictures and have them look good on mobile and desktop. The Zephair page is an example of this, the image at the top switches using JavaScript and it's style is written in CSS.
The adaptation to mobile is also done in CSS which senses the device size and either stacks the image above the text or places the
image to the right of the text.
