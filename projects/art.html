  <h3>Mountains</h3>
  <p>
    Spray paint painting is fun because it's easy to use objects around you for textures and outlines.
    For example in the painting of pyramids, the pyramids were outlined by using three sheets of news paper and the texture came from
    lifting up those sheets of news paper. The outline of the sun was created with a frisbee and the texture on the planets was created
    using newspaper folded and crumpled in different ways.

  <h3>Lightning</h3>
  <p>
    When moving into my house at college the whole thing was ugly and poorly taken care of. Especially the basement, which was downright scary.
    I put in some bright LED light bulbs which made it less scary but it still felt cold and uninviting. I decided to add some art.
    This painting of lightning with a rainbow trail was all done freehanded with spray paint and made half the basement feel much more inviting.

  <h3>Triangle</h3>
  <p>
    To add another edition to the basement this triangle was done on the other side of the basement. The clean lines and sharp corners were done
    with the help of duct tape. everything else was free handed. Almost every wall in the basement is painted now turning it into the go to study spot.

  <h3>Eclipse</h3>
  <p>
    I needed a large art piece to take up some space in my new room because the walls were a pretty gross shade of white and the room needed some help.
    I painted this right after seeing the 2017 total eclipse in tenessee, the eclipse was an awesome experience and this painting across four canvases
    is trying to show the darkness that washes over during a total eclipse. Seeing stars during the day with a 360 degree sunset all around is an
    amazing experience.
