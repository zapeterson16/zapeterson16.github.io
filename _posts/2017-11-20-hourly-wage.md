excerpt: "Hourly wage has an incentive problem, human time is too hard to quantify"

There are two major pay systems, salary and hourly. Hourly has many more problems though. Hourly pay awards laziness and discourages efficiency. Hourly pay is used in many contract applications. And also for pay in lower level employment. Hourly pay make sense in a few situations but is used in way too many situations.

One of the biggest flaws in charging hourly is that it values human time like it is a currency. A currency is always worth the same amount, at least in relation to itself. If I have a ten dollar bill and I trade it to a friend for ten one dollar bills I can be confident that I still have the same amount of money because every dollar is worth a dollar. Human time does not hold the same level of constant value. If you feel focused and driven for an hour you could easily get the amount done as 2 or more hours of work when you feel less driven. As an hourly worker working harder to get something done is bittersweet, there is a sense of accomplishment that you did something faster but you will get either paid less or get more work to do to fill up the rest of your time.

Of course there are benefits to working harder which are promotions and raises, but that reward is too far out to be a motivator in the everyday drive to increase efficiency. Everyone wants a promotion but if you could work harder right now and instantly get paid more because you are working more efficiently it would be easy to make that decision every day to work harder since there is an instant reward. This shows even more in free-lance work and work that is billed hourly.

For a company that is billing hours it makes sense that they would want their employees to work as fast as possible because they could quote jobs for less and be more efficient as a company. But when you’re working on a job and you want to give the bill to the customer the company gets paid more the less efficient they work on that job. The customer would be happier if you worked more efficiently but they are going to have to pay it either way. This is why work should not be quoted based on hours then adjusted based on how many hours it actually took.

When a company quotes a job they internally should take into account how many hours it will take but should charge the customer a flat rate regardless of how slow or fast the employees work on the project. This also applies to free lance work. If you get paid a set amount per hour to work but aren’t working at your full potential all the time you get paid less for working faster. Of course there would be more work put into quoting each job separately and charging for it flat rate but working more efficiently would provide instant gratification. Eventually you could charge more for your time but creating a raise like that seems like you are charging the business more even though you are getting more efficient and would be charging the same amount but working less efficiently on it.

Overall hourly wage would be a good pay system if human time was as reliable currency but it’s not and therefore provides negative motivation to work as efficiently as possible and get more done in the same amount of time.
