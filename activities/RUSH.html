  <h2>My Contribution</h2>
Being at Team RUSH was how I spent almost all my free time in high school. For me during build season it was almost every day except sunday from after school until 9 and from 9 to 4 on saturday.
When I started I jumped in on the programming sub-team and was the back-up robot operator freshman year. My sophomore year I took on the <a href = "/projects/scoutingApp/">scouting app</a> and it was
our most successful scouting app. I also took on more of the software development my sophomore year and was the robot operator for competitions. My junior year I was the captain of the Programming
sub-team and developed a majority of the software for the robot in LabVIEW and was still the robot operator. My senior year I was the team captain and wrote all of the software for the robot with
help from Wineman Technology on the autonomous software. Find out more about that <a href = "/projects/2016Autononmous/">here</a>. My senior year I was also the robot operator for the last time.
