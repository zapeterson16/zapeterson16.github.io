      <h2>About Team RUSH</h2>

  <h2>My Contribution</h2>
Being at Team RUSH was how I spent almost all my free time in high school. A typical build season for me meant working every day except Sunday from after school until at least 9pm, and from 9am to 4pm on Saturday.
When I started as a freshman, I jumped in on the programming sub-team and was the back-up robot operator. My sophomore year, I programmed the <a href = "/fun_projects/scoutingApp/">scouting app</a>,
which was our most successful scouting app to date. I also took on more of the software development, and was the robot operator for competitions. During my junior year, I was the captain of the programming
sub-team, developed a majority of the software for the robot in LabVIEW, and was still the robot operator. My senior year, I was the team captain and wrote all of the software for the robot, with
help from Wineman Technology on the autonomous software. Find out more about that <a href = "/fun_projects/2016Autononmous/">here</a>. I was also the robot operator for the third year.
