      I am a member of the <a href = "https://www.facebook.com/JugglersOnCampus">Jugglers On Campus at U of M</a>. My favorite types of juggling are passing pins
      and working on numbers; I can juggle 4 right now and am working on juggling 5. <br><br>
      I learned to juggle balls from my mom, and learned to do pins and pass at the Motor City Juggling Club at Oakland University. I've juggled at a few charity events
      and was a guest actor as a jester in a play.
