    <p>
      Member of the <a href = "https://www.facebook.com/JugglersOnCampus">Jugglers on Campus at U of M</a>. My favorite juggling is passing pins
      and working on numbers, I can juggle 4 right now and Am working on juggling 5. <br><br>
      I learned to juggle balls from my mom and learned to do pins and pass at the Motor city juggling club. I've juggled at a few charity events
      and was a guest actor as a jester in a play.
