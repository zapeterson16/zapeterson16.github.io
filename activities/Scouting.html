The mission of the Boy Scouts of America is to prepare young people to make ethical
and moral choices over their lifetimes by instilling in them the values of the Scout Oath and Law.

      <h2>High adventure</h2>
While scouting I went to Philmont twice. Philmont is in New Mexico and is one of the four high adventure bases that the Boy Scouts own. The first time I went in 2013 I was
our trek leader and went with other members and adults from troop 51. We hiked 83 miles is 12 days and it was a great experience.
The second time I went with the Order of the Arrow, which is the Boy Scout honor society. I was part of a trail building team where
we were building trail near the top of mt. Phillips. On one of the days there was a massive hail storm even though it was the middle of summer
and it caused flooding throughout New Mexico. After finishing building trail we hiked 80 miles in 6 days. One of the days we hiked 24 miles with full packs.
I never would have thought that I could hike 24 miles in a day with a 50 pound pack, this experience of overcoming arbitrary limits that I had mentally
set myself was the most powerful moment for me in scouting.

  <h2>Eagle Scout</h2>
In October of 2013 I was awarded the rank of Eagle Scout. For my eagle scout project I created an easy to clean modular cat hangout for kitty
city at the Oakland County animal shelter. When I was looking for a project I contacted the animal shelter and asked if there was anything I could do.
They said one of their biggest problems is their cat play structures. People donate the carpeted play structures all the time.
When a cat pees on one of these structures the carpet is very hard to clean and usually the structures end up being thrown away.
I wanted to create something that was still cozy for the cats but would last longer and be easy to clean.
What I came up with was cat boxes. They were a series of open ended wooden boxes that were all the same size.
They could be stacked in any configuration so that they could fit any space.
I coated them in a non-toxic hydrophopic coating so that when a cat peed on part of a structure it could be cleaned with ease.
To make the wood more comfortable and appealing I cut out many carpet squares which fit inside the boxes which would be easy to replace or clean if they got dirty.

  <a href = "http://troop51-bsa.com"><h2>Troop 51</h2></a>
  The troop went on camping/hiking trips almost every month and went to summer camp every summer. Along with having weekly meetings.
  Within troop 51 I held many leadership positions. I started out as the patrol leader for my first patrol. I then became the patrol leader for the
  incoming new scouts to help them get acquainted with the troop. After that I was the senior patrol leader which is the highest position in the troop.
  After being senior patrol leader for a year, I stepped into an assistant advisory role as an assistant senior patrol leader.
