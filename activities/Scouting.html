The mission of the Boy Scouts of America is to prepare young people to make ethical
and moral choices over their lifetimes by instilling in them the values of the Scout Oath and Law.

      <h2>High adventure</h2>
As a Boy Scout I went to Philmont Scout Ranch twice. Philmont covers 140,177 acres of wilderness in the Sangre de Cristo Mountains of the Rocky Mountains of northern New Mexico
and is one of the four high-adventure bases that the Boy Scouts own. The first time I went in 2013, I served as the trek leader for
a group of seven scouts and three adults from my troop. We hiked 83 miles is 12 days and it was a great experience.
My second trip to Philmont was with the Order of the Arrow, the Boy Scout honor society. I was part of a trail-building team where
we were carving a trail into the mountainside near the top of Mt. Phillips. After finishing trailbuilding, we hiked 80 miles in 6 days, including a one-day hike
of 24 miles with full 50-pound packs.
I never would have thought that I could hike so far with a full pack; this experience of overcoming mental limits
was the most powerful moment for me in Scouting.

  <h2>Eagle Scout</h2>
In October of 2013, I was awarded the rank of Eagle Scout at the age of 14. For my Eagle Scout project, I created an easy-to-clean modular cat hangout for "Kitty
City" at the Oakland County Animal Ahelter. When I was looking for a project, I contacted the animal shelter and asked if there was anything I could do.
They said one of their biggest problems is their cat play structures. The shelter used carpeted play structures, but
when a cat peed on one of these structures, the carpet was very hard to clean and the structures often needed to be thrown away.
I wanted to create something that was still cozy for the cats, but would last longer and be easy to clean.
What I came up with was "cat boxes," a series of open-ended wooden boxes that were all the same size.
They could be stacked in any configuration so that they could fit any space.
I coated them in a non-toxic hydrophobic coating, so that when a cat peed on part of a structure, it could be cleaned with ease.
To make the wood more comfortable and appealing, I cut out many carpet squares which would fit inside the boxes and be easy to replace or clean if they got dirty.

  The troop went on camping/hiking trips almost every month and went to summer camp every summer, along with having weekly meetings.
  Within Troop 51, I held many leadership positions. I started out as the patrol leader for my first patrol. I then became the patrol leader for the
  incoming new scouts to help them get acquainted with the troop. After that, I was the senior patrol leader, which is the highest position in the troop.
  After being senior patrol leader for a year, I stepped into an assistant advisory role as an assistant senior patrol leader.
