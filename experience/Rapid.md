## About Rapid Prototype Company
<a href = "https://www.rpparts.com">Rapid Prototype Company</a> is a rapid prototyping company that focuses on creating stereolithography parts as well as small production runs with silicon molds.

### Stereolithography
Stereolithography is a manufacturing technique where a machine shines lasers at a liquid and the liquid hardens. Then the plate moves down and the laser shines again. This keeps happening until the part is created.


### My Job
I was focused on designing the support structures that would get printed along with the part. The support structures needed to be designed in a way that would properly support the part but also be easy to remove. I also worked with a few of the technicians on cleaning and sanblasting parts to create a finished product.
