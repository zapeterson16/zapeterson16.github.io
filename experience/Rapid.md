## About Rapid Prototype Company
<a href = "https://www.rpparts.com">Rapid Prototype Company</a> is a rapid prototyping company that focuses on creating stereolithography parts as well as small production runs with silicon molds.

### Stereolithography
Stereolithography is a manufacturing technique where a machine shines lasers at a liquid and the liquid hardens. Then the plate moves down and the laser shines again. This keeps happening until the part is created.


### Big project
My largest project was creating drivers for LabVIEW that would allow commands to be used in the typical block style of G but allow communication to serial devices where each serial command became it's own block.
