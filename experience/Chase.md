## About Chase Plastics
<a href = "http://chaseplastics.com">Chase Plastics</a> is a plastics distribution company. Chase Plastics is North Americaâ€™s leading distributor of specialty, engineering and commodity resins.

### My role
My role at Chase Plastics was to assist the information technology manager. I preformed typical IT tasks such as solving computer issues and setting up new computers, but when there was a break in those tasks I had the opportunity to work on a few larger tasks. One of my projects was making the inhouse company information network more effective. I used Xibo display which read from our company's RSS feed to display company news as well as important information about upcoming events within the company. Another fun project that I was a part of was a security shakedown of the company. We brought in a security company to analyze the strength of our security and how susceptible we were to attacks. There were many interesting aspects to this, but the most insightful was when we went around at lunch time and looked under phones and keyboards for passwords. We were able to get into over 10% of the computers in the company just by searching around people's desks.


### Big project
My largest project was creating a sign-in system which improved safety in the case of a fire as well as making it simpler to sign-in. I started with an SQL database that was hosted locally through phpMyAdmin; the front end of the system was created using HTML, CSS and PHP. The final system had two tablets (one at each entrance) where employees would enter their extension number which would sign them in or out. The system was built upon by the next intern to integrate an RFID reader so that employees could just tap their badge to sign in. For this project I was awarded the companies LEAN award for improving company efficiency.
