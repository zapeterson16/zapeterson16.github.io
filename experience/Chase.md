## About Chase Plastics
<a href = "http://chaseplastics.com">Chase Plastics</a> is a plastics distribution company. Chase Plastics is North Americaâ€™s leading stocking distributor of specialty, engineering and commodity resins.

### My role
My role at Chase Plastics was to assist the IT-guy. I did the normal IT stuff like solve computer issues and set up new computers but when there was a break in those tasks I had the opportunity to work on a few larger tasks. One of my projects was making the company displays more effective. I used Xibo display which read from our companies RSS feed for company news as well as had important information about upcoming events within the company. Another fun project that I was a part of was a security shake down of the company. We brought in a security company to analyze the strength of our security and how susceptible we are to attacks. There were many cool things I got to see during this, but the most insightful was when we went around at lunch time and looked under phone's and keyboards for passwords. We were able to get in 10/80 of the computers at the company just by searching around people's desks.


### Big project
My largest project was creating a sign in system which improved safety in the case of a fire as well as made it simpler to sign in. I started with an SQL database that was hosted locally through phpMyAdmin, the front end of the system was created using HTML, CSS and PHP. The final system had two tablets one at each entrance where employees would enter their extension number which would sign them in or out. The system was built upon by the next intern to integrate an RFID reader so that employees could just tap their badge to sign in. For this project I was awarded the LEAN award for improving company efficiency.
