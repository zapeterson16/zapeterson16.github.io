## About Wineman Technology
<a href = "https://www.winemantech.com/">Wineman Technology</a> is a system integrator specializing in custom equipment
to provide insight through electromechanical test. The Clarkston office which I interned at focused on the electrical designing
and software development of these systems.

### LabVIEW
LabVIEW is a programming suite created by National Instruments to run hardware developed by National Instruments.
LabVIEW uses the G visual programming language. I started learning LabVIEW on my robotics team in high school.
When I started at Wineman I read two textbooks cover to cover in a week to get acquainted with LabVIEW.
After finishing the textbooks I worked on sample project with my co-workers doing code reviews with me along the way.
My coworkers were all certified LabVIEW Architects which is the highest level of LabVIEW certification.
I am now a Certified LabVIEW Associate Developer.


### Big project
My largest project was creating drivers for LabVIEW that would allow commands to be used in the typical block style of G but allow communication to serial devices where each serial command became it's own block.
