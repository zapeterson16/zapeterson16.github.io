## About Wineman Technology
<a href = "https://www.winemantech.com/">Wineman Technology</a> is a system integrator specializing in custom equipment
to provide insight through electromechanical tests. I interned at the Clarkston office, which focused on the electrical design
and software development of these systems.

### LabVIEW
LabVIEW is a programming suite created by National Instruments to run hardware developed by National Instruments.
LabVIEW uses the G visual programming language. I started learning LabVIEW on my robotics team in high school,
and when I started at Wineman, I read two textbooks cover-to-cover in a week to get acquainted with LabVIEW.
After finishing the textbooks, I worked on several demo projects, with my co-workers doing code reviews with me along the way.
My co-workers were all certified LabVIEW Architects, which is the highest level of LabVIEW certification.
I am now a Certified LabVIEW Associate Developer.


### Big project
My largest project was creating drivers for LabVIEW that would allow commands to be used in the typical block style of G, but allow communication to serial devices where each serial command became its own block.
