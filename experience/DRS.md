## About Dynamic Robotic Solutions
<a href = "http://www.drsrobotics.com/na//">Dynamic Robotic Solutions</a> is a robotics company that designs and builds robotic cells from start to finish. Most of the design work is done in SolidWorks while other software is used to simulate the cells and do the electrical design. The software development for the robots is done mostly with ladder logic. DRS has a current focus on water jetting, router cutting and laser cutting robotic cells.

### My Role
At Dynamic Robotic Solutions I worked with the engineers on their robotic cell designs and also had the opportunity to see the electrical design, programming and animation of the robots.

### Big project
My largest project was creating a sensor mount that held an accelerometer. Check out the picture of the sensor mount below. It holds an accelerometer and has attachment points to connect to the the end of the robot. It is now sold as a part of the advanced robot calibration package.
