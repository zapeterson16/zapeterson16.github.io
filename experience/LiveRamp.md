### My role
I am a Software Engineer on the Outbond Platform Integrations team. The Outbound Platform Integrations team supports our integrations with downstream platforms, the main service we support is a big data pipeline which transforms and distributes 200TB/day to over 500 destinations. My work is primarily in Java, using the Spring framework for http APIs and Cascading on top of Hadoop for Big Data processing.


### Example project
I co-lead a project to design and build a new HTTP API with Spring. The API created a new interface boundry de-coupling a legacy system from a core component of the Outbound Platform Integrations team. This enabled new business verticals to utilize the existing system and remove duplication across systems.
