## About LiveRamp
<a href = "http://liveramp.com">LiveRamp</a> is a data connectivity platform in the ad-tech space. LiveRamp makes data safe and easy to use. Supporting the translation between ID spaces allowing small online publishers to compete with the ad powerhouses like Facebook and Google.

### My role
I am a Staff Software Engineer currently on the Embedded Identity team. Previously I've worked on Outbound Platform Integrations, Taxonomy, and Connectivity teams. My work spans multiple technologies including Java/Spring, Hadoop, Spark, Snowflake, and JavaScript. I've built everything from customer-facing web applications to large-scale data processing pipelines handling hundreds of terabytes daily.

### Example Projects
On the Embedded Identity team, I developed and launched a Snowflake Native Application that enables customers to match identifiers to RampID using LiveRamp's identity graph within their own environment. I achieved a 100x performance improvement from the initial release, reducing execution times from hours to minutes and significantly lowering operational costs.

Previously on the Outbound Platform Integrations team, I managed a data pipeline distributing 200TB/day across over 500 integrations. I led the modernization of a Hadoop service to Spark, improving scalability and reliability while processing 120TB/day.

On the Taxonomy team, I co-led the design and implementation of a Java/Spring API for managing data taxonomies and synchronizing them with other platforms. This enabled new business verticals to leverage existing infrastructure through seamless integration of data taxonomy services.
