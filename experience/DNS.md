## About Delta Network Services
<a href = "http://www.delta-ns.com">Delta</a> is a full network services company that designs and installs network systems in schools and businesses.
Delta looks for the best products and works to integrate them together into the best network system.

### My Role
While at Delta, my main jobs was to use engineering drawings to configure network switches appropriately, as well as install the network switches on site. I also worked closely with engineers while they were designing the network layouts.


### Company Dynamic
Delta worked hard to create a great company dynamic; one initiative along these lines was everyone eating together every day. The company would order out for food, or if we were at a job site we would go out to eat together; it was a great company perk/way to bring the employees together.
