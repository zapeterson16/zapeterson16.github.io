## About Delta Network Services
<a href = "http://www.delta-ns.com">Delta</a> is a full network services company that designs and installs network systems in schools and businesses.
Delta looks for the best products and works hard to integrate them together into the best network system.

### My Role
While at Delta my main jobs were looking at the engineering drawings and configuring the network switches appropriately as well as installing the network switches on site. I also got to work closely with the engineers when they were designing the network layouts.


### Company Dynamic
Delta worked hard to create a great company dynamic, one of the great ideas was everyone eating together everyday. We would order food or if we were at a job site we would go out to eat and it was a great company perk/way to bring the company together.
