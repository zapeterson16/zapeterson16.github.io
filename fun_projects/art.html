  <h3>Pyramids</h3>
  <p>
    Spray paint painting is fun because it's easy to use objects around you for textures and outlines.
    For example, in the painting of pyramids, the pyramids were outlined by using three sheets of newspaper, and the texture came from
    lifting up those sheets of newspaper. The outline of the sun was created with a frisbee and the texture on the planets was created
    using newspaper folded and crumpled in different ways.

  <h3>Lightning</h3>
  <p>
    My first off-campus house in college was ugly and poorly taken care of, especially the basement, which was downright scary.
    I put in some bright LED light bulbs which made it less scary, but it still felt cold and uninviting. I decided to add some art.
    This painting of lightning with a rainbow trail was all done free-handed with spray paint and made half of the basement feel much more inviting.

  <h3>Triangle</h3>
  <p>
    To further enhance the basement, this triangle was done on the other side of the room. The clean lines and sharp corners were done
    with the help of duct tape; everything else was free-handed. Almost every wall in the basement is painted, turning it into the go-to study spot.

  <h3>Eclipse</h3>
  <p>
    I needed a large art piece to take up some space in my new room.
    I painted this right after seeing the 2017 total eclipse in Tennessee; the eclipse was an awesome experience, and this painting across four canvases
    is trying to show the darkness that washes over during a total eclipse. Seeing stars during the day with a 360 degree sunset all around is an
    amazing experience.
