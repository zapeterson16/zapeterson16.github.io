    At FIRST robotics competitions, having data about the robots you are playing with and against is very important.
    Team RUSH is very serious about data collection, and collects data on every robot during every match.
    To handle this type of active data collection, the scouting app was born.

  <h3>The App</h3>
  <p>
    The app was developed in Objective-C and ran on 6 iPads at the competition. During each match, a scouter was assigned to each of six robots on the field.
    The app created a CSV file for each robot in each match.
    The data stored in CSV files was synced with a computer using an Excel macro that compiled the data: from there, the data was analyzed with Tableau.
    I was responsible for developing the app and getting the data from the app to the computer. (Check out the finished app below.)
    Each year we also printed paper scouting sheets in case the app didn't function like it was supposed to.
    The app pictured below was the first version in team history that did not require reverting to scouting on paper.
