## About Me

<b>School:</b> I am a third-year student studying computer science at the University of Michigan. I will be graduating in 2019 (after three years). I previously attended CSMTech (Clarkston Science, Math, and Technology) Academy at Clarkston High School in Clarkston, Michigan.

### Passions
<b>Technology:</b> I love new technology and photography. Zephair, my drone photography company, is the incarnation of both of these.

<b>Travel:</b> Seeing new places is my favorite pastime. My favorite place so far was Switzerland, with Kauai being a close second.

<b>Outdoors:</b> The outdoors are great, especially camping and hiking. My best trip so far has been trail building at Philmont Scout Ranch in New Mexico. We spent eight days building trails near the peak of Mt. Phillips, then hiked 80 miles in 5 days.

<b>Hobbies:</b> I enjoy learning new things, like juggling, unicycling, solving a Rubik's cube, editing video or flying a drone. Finding something new to learn is how I like to spend my free time.
