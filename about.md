<b>School:</b> I am a sophomore studying computer science with a minor in business at the University of Michigan

### Passions
<b>Technology:</b> I love new technology and photography. Zephair, my drone photography company is the incarnation of both of these.

<b>Travel:</b> Seeing new places is my favorite past time. My favorite place so far was Switzerland with Kauai being a close second.

<b>Outdoors:</b> The outdoors are great, especially camping and hiking. The best trip I've gone was trail building at Philmont in New Mexico. We spent ten days building trail near the peak of mt. Phillips, then hiked 80 miles in 5 days.

<b>Hobbies:</b> I enjoy learning new things, like juggling, unicycling, solving a Rubik's cube, editing video or flying a drone. Finding something new to learn is how I like to spend my free time.
