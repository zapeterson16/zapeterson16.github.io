## About Me

<b>Work:</b> I work for LiveRamp, a data connectivity platform mostly in the ad-tech space based in San Francisco. You can read more about my experience at LiveRamp <a href="/experience/LiveRamp/">here</a>. Previously I worked for a drone company I founded, along with interning at five companies; see the <a href = "/experince">experience</a> page for more details.

<b>School:</b> I'm a University of Michigan Alum and studied computer science. I graduated in 2019 (after three years). I previously attended CSMTech (Clarkston Science, Math, and Technology) Academy at Clarkston High School in Clarkston, Michigan.

### Passions
<b>Technology:</b> I love new technology and photography. Zephair, my drone photography company, is the incarnation of both of these.

<b>Travel:</b> Seeing new places is my favorite pastime. My favorite place so far was Switzerland, with Japan and Kauai being a close seconds.

<b>Outdoors:</b> The outdoors are great, especially camping and hiking and surfing. My best trip so far has been trail building at Philmont Scout Ranch in New Mexico. We spent eight days building trails near the peak of Mt. Phillips, then hiked 80 miles in 5 days.

<b>Hobbies:</b> I enjoy learning new things, like juggling, unicycling, solving a Rubik's cube, editing video or flying a drone. Finding something new to learn is how I like to spend my free time.
